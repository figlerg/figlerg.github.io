{% raw %}
**RoadLogic** is a logic-based planning and simulation framework for road and traffic scenarios.
It synthesizes high-level driving plans using **Answer Set Programming (ASP)** and supports scenario specifications in **OpenSCENARIO 2.1 DSL**.
The generated plans can be executed and evaluated through **CommonRoad** and the **Frenetix Motion Planner**.

## Reproducibility Evaluation
See [REPRODUCIBILITY.md](https://github.com/figlerg/roadlogic/blob/main/REPRODUCIBILITY.md) and the PDF version [REPRODUCIBILITY.pdf](https://github.com/figlerg/roadlogic/blob/main/REPRODUCIBILITY.pdf).

## Overview

RoadLogic provides:

* Declarative reasoning for scenario-based planning
* Automatic plan synthesis from OpenSCENARIO 2.1 descriptions
* Execution interface for CommonRoad simulations
* Integration with the Frenetix motion-planning library

> **Status:** This branch is frozen for reproducibility. Active development continues on the [main branch](https://github.com/figlerg/roadlogic).

## Installation
### Docker
To reproduce the figures in the paper, just use the Dockerfile. The experiments run for about 10h in total on my Dell Latitude with a 12th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-1265U. Your mileage may vary (and the computation time with it).

- Inside this folder, run
````docker build -t roadlogic-artifact .````

- Run the container. 
````docker run --rm -it --name roadlogic-artifact roadlogic-artifact````
**Be careful:** remove ``--rm`` if you want the container to persist after usage.

- Run the script to reproduce the Figures from the paper
````bash paper/reproduce_experiments.sh````

- This part takes about 10h.
- Find the results under ````paper/figures````


### Set up locally

#### Prerequisites
- Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS (or WSL on Windows)
- make
- git
- pyenv

#### Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/figlerg/roadlogic.git
cd roadlogic

# using pyenv
pyenv install 3.10.16
pyenv local 3.10.16
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# check
python --version
which python

# pip install
pip install -U pip wheel setuptools
pip install -e ./Frenetix-Motion-Planner   # local submodule
pip install -e .                           # roadlogic itself
```

---

### Test

```bash
python -m planning.Planner plans --osc2_file tests/overtake.osc -n 3 -a # run planning engine standalone
bash experiments_src/exp_001/run.sh # run the experiments with their shell script. see shell script for some make examples
```

The experiments are carried out like this. Assume there is an experiment folder `EXP` with folders `EXP/in` and `EXP/out`, and a specification `EXP/in/spec.osc`. Then plans, plots and metrics can be generated as follows (see `experiments_src/common.sh` for the full pipeline):

```bash
N=10                    # number of plans
STEP_LENGTH=60          # number of discarded plans before selecting the next, has minor impact on model diversity

# actual planning module
make generate-osc-scenarios \
    OSC_N="$N" \
    OSC_FILE="$EXP/in/spec.osc" \
    OUTPUT_FOLDER="$EXP/out/cr_simulations" \
    SCENARIOS_FOLDER="$EXP/out" \
    STEP_LENGTH="$STEP_LENGTH" \
    RULE_INJECTION="$EXP/in/rule_injection.lp"

# simulate in CommonRoad (no visualization)
make execute-all-scenarios \
    SCENARIOS_FOLDER="$EXP/out/cr_scenarios" \
    OUTPUT_FOLDER="$EXP/out/cr_simulations"

# compute metrics for the monitor
make -j 8 \
    SCENARIOS_FOLDER="$EXP/out/cr_scenarios" \
    OUTPUT_FOLDER="$EXP/out/cr_simulations" \
    compute-selected-metrics-for-all-scenarios

# compute monitoring results from the metrics (witnesses satisfaction)
make generate-summary \
    SCENARIOS_FOLDER="$EXP/out/cr_scenarios" \
    OUTPUT_FOLDER="$EXP/out/cr_simulations" \
    OSC_FILE="$EXP/in/spec.osc"

# build a similarity matrix for the generated plans
python commonroad_extensions/simulation_analysis/similarity.py \
    --plans-folder "$EXP/out/serialized_models" \
    --output-folder "$EXP/out/similarity"
```
